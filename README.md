# FaceDetector

Want to detect human faces on a camera preview stream in real time? Well, you came to the right place.

FaceDetector is:

- detects faces
- works on Android
- very simple to use
- comes with (Fotoapparat)[https://github.com/Fotoapparat/Fotoapparat] integration (but you can use it with whatever you like)
- with a C++ core which can easily be ported to iOS (we have plans for that)
